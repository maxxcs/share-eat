# Share Eat

## Getting Started

First, run the production server:

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the share-eat app.

If you are running this in another port than 3000, you will need to pass the `BASE_URL=http://localhost:<PORT>` env variable to access the API.
